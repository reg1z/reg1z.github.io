Vagrant can use different providers such as Docker, VirtualBox, VMware, and even AWS for cloud-based deployments. Provision Provision is the term used to perform an action using Vagrant. This can be actions such as adding new files or running a script to configure the host created with Vagrant. Configure Configure is used to perform configuration changes using Vagrant. This can be changed by adding a network interface to a host or changing its hostname. Variable A variable stores some value that will be used in the Vagrant deployment script.

Template Ansible allows for the creation of template files. These act as your base files, like a configuration file, with placeholders for Ansible variables, which will then be injected into at runtime to create a final file that can be deployed to the host. Using Ansible variables means that you can change the value of the variable in a single location and it will then propagate through to all placeholders in your configuration. Role Ansible allows for the creation of a collection of templates and instructions that are then called roles. A host that will be provisioned can then be assigned one or more of these roles, executing the entire template for the host. This allows you to reuse the role definition with a single line of configuration where you specify that the role must be provisioned on a host. Variable A variable stores some value that will be used in the Ansible deployment script. Ansible can take this a step further by having variable files where each file has different values for the same variables, and the decision is then made at runtime for which variable file will be used.","tags":["tryhackme/rooms"]},{"location":"My%20Notes/Challenges%20and%20CTFs%20%E2%9A%94%EF%B8%8F/tryhackme/rooms/On-Premises%20IaC/#differences-between-vagrant-and-ansible","title":"Differences Between Vagrant and Ansible","text":"Feature/Aspect Vagrant Ansible Configuration Language Ruby (for Vagrantfiles).

In some circumstances it is desirable or necessary to combine multiple interfaces onto a single broadcast domain, where two ports on the firewall will act as if they are on the same switch, except traffic between the interfaces can be controlled with firewall rules. Typically this is done so multiple interfaces will act as though they are on the same flat network using the same IP subnet and so that clients all share broadcast and multicast traffic.</p> <p>Certain applications and devices rely on broadcasts to function, but these are found more commonly in home environments than corporate environments. For a practical discussion, see Bridging and wireless.</p> <p>For services running on the firewall, bridging can be problematic. Features such as limiters, Captive Portal, and transparent proxies require special configuration and handling to work on bridged networks. Specifically, the bridge itself must be assigned and the only interface on the bridge with an IP address must be the assigned bridge. Also, in order for these functions to work, the IP address on the bridge must be the address used by clients as their gateway.

Vagrant can use different providers such as Docker, VirtualBox, VMware, and even AWS for cloud-based deployments. Provision Provision is the term used to perform an action using Vagrant. This can be actions such as adding new files or running a script to configure the host created with Vagrant. Configure Configure is used to perform configuration changes using Vagrant. This can be changed by adding a network interface to a host or changing its hostname. Variable A variable stores some value that will be used in the Vagrant deployment script. Box The Box refers to the image that will be provisioned by Vagrant.

For clarity's sake, know that in this post I use the terms \"first principles\" and \"fundamentals\" interchangeably.</p> <p>Lifelong learning is essential for a lasting infosec career. For the past year or so, as I've worked toward expanding my knowledge and skill set, I've dealt with a persistent internal dilemma.</p> <p>I like to know the bare truth behind systems. How they work; how individual first principles come together to make a larger whole. Naturally, this doesn't seem like a problem. The first principles\u2014the fundamentals\u2014are the most important, no? At least, that's what my teachers did their best to hammer home. Lately, however, that lesson is continually called into question.</p> <p>In cybersecurity\u2014and similarly, in many IT-related fields\u2014practical necessity often forces us to learn tools rather than the underlying first principles. The industry is results-oriented: knowing how to quickly secure systems, respond to incidents, or manage infrastructure often matters more immediately than grasping the theoretical fundamentals behind every tool or practice. This pragmatic approach isn\u2019t inherently flawed\u2014it's effective\u2014but it creates tension when considering long-term knowledge retention and adaptability. As the availability and sophistication of AI-powered tools grow, it becomes even easier to focus purely on immediate outcomes, potentially at the expense of deeper understanding.</p> <p>The fact remains: first principles are of extreme importance. It's necessary to have some understanding of an underlying system and its processes before you can truly validate its state\u2014its safety. That being said, there is no such thing as a \"perfect\" security attestation. Security is fluid. Ensuring security requires ongoing vigilance. Failing to remain vigilant inevitably invites risk. And so, we rely on our tools to get the job done. We have to\u2014we often have little time for much else.</p> <p>More and more, we're relying on outsourcing our understanding of some domain (in this case, information security) to the LLM. To the tool. What use is there in cognitively front-loading all the fundamentals when you can just have the model worry about them? And if the model doesn't have the capability, can't you just fill in the gaps as necessary?</p> <p>Students and knowledge workers, especially those in IT-oriented fields, are faced with this dilemma as the age of AI progresses. The value proposition of putting the effort into learning first principles versus simply relying on outsourced intelligences to solve your problems is genuinely DIFFICULT to calculate on your own. This value is always in flux as the capabilities of models continue to enable more and more sophisticated agentic behavior. </p> <p>On one hand, AI tooling can allow you to see the bigger picture. It can just as easily augment your ability to understand fundamental first principles. It's an amazing learning tool.</p> <p>On the other hand, it gives one an intelligent \"cudgel\" to smash their problems with. You can tell it to do Z without having to know X and Y yourself. Because it already has all the information it needs\u2014usually.</p> <p>It's hard to avoid sentiments online that young and future generations could be at career disadvantages as the capability and dynamism of AI agents continue to outpace the rate at which humans can acquire similar skillsets. There's no telling whether this will actually be the case. Optimists often claim that AI agents will merely automate the boring parts, freeing up cognitive space for humans to focus on what only humans are good at. There's no telling whether this will actually be the case. And there lies the dilemma. At this point, it's impossible to know.</p> <p>I don't mean to portray AI tools negatively. They've been of great use to me. Still, whenever studying on my own\u2014typically the fundamentals of some IT-related domain, programming language, etc\u2014I find myself asking a series of questions: \"Are first principles becoming distractions? Am I wasting time mastering them, while others leap into AI tools and find rapid success? Will diving directly into results-oriented projects with these tools offer a faster, equally robust understanding? How does their usage align with personal privacy concerns\u2014especially since these models often handle sensitive data behind closed doors without clear transparency or guarantees of trust?\"</p> <p>It's a real rabbit hole. And though I am resolved in the beliefs that an understanding of first principles will always remain important and that some measure of human intervention within our systems will always be necessary, I grow uncertain as to how practical and feasible they will remain as time passes.</p> <p>Are these tools changing the way you learn? The way you approach problems? Do you feel over-reliant at all? Or do you not see it that way? What are your feelings regarding the bigger picture? What else?</p>","tags":["cybersecurity","llm"]},{"location":"2025/02/27/preparing-for-a-blue-team-competition-as-a-beginner/","title":"Preparing for a Blue Team Competition as a Beginner","text":"<p>This past February, I began volunteering in WGU's Cyber Club.
