# systemd
- ***overview of systemd***
	- Why?: It's the predominant init system and service manager used on most modern Linux systems.
	- potential topics
		- most commonly encountered systemd services
		- PRACTICAL USE. Actually using the tools instead of conceptual knowledge delivery.
			- What would be a good way to set up a relevant scenario? Set up a VM/tryhackme room for download?
	- factors
		- history (I don't want to go into this too much)
			- systemd was controversial when it was first proposed. Origin story of Lennart Poettering and previous init systems
			- systemd's *alternate* approach was controversial, but enabled/encouraged new ways of doing things that didn't always have to follow a standard model. It wasn't boxed-in by existing standards.
				- this created some rifts in the UNIX community. many projects use different init systems (bsd, etc)
