- **Removing Directories with `rmdir`**
    - `rmdir` (Remove Directory) deletes empty folders.
    - Requires the **file path** of the directory to remove.
    - Can use **relative or absolute paths** for flexibility.
    - Use `ls` to verify the directory was deleted.
- **Using `history` to View Previous Commands**
    - `history` displays previously run commands.
    - Arrow keys **navigate command history** (`Up` to recall, `Down` to move forward).
    - Servers may store **up to 1,000 commands**, making history useful for tracking changes.
- **Re-running Commands from History**
    - Use `!<command_number>` to re-run a specific command.
    - Find the number using `history` and execute `!12` to run command #12.
    - Avoids excessive **scrolling through history** with arrow keys.
