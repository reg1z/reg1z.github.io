- **Opening the Terminal**    
    - Use GUI options like **right-click â†’ Open Terminal** or search for "Terminal" in applications.
    - Some Linux distributions, like CentOS, default to the **command line only**.
- **Finding Your Location in the File System**
    - The `pwd` command (Print Working Directory) shows your **current directory**.
    - User and computer information appear in the **command prompt** (e.g., `sandbox@ubuntu`).
- **Moving Between Directories**
    - `cd` (Change Directory) lets you navigate through folders.
    - The **root directory (`/`)** is the top-level location in Linux.
    - `cd ..` moves **up one level**, while `cd` alone **returns to the home directory**.
    - `cd ~` is a shortcut to go **directly to the home directory**.
- **Listing and Understanding File Structure**
    - `ls` lists contents of a directory.
    - Different Linux distributions have **slight variations** in file structures.
- **Efficient Navigation Techniques**
    - **Use Tab for auto-completion** to avoid typing errors.
    - You can move multiple folders at once with `cd /home/sandbox/Desktop`.
    - The tilde `~` represents **your home directory**, which varies by user.
